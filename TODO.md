##### Tasks to do:

- cross-server inventory spectating
- fix per-world-inventory integration? (inventories always empty) I think I should just drop PWI - it's unmaintained.
- integration for Multiverse-Inventories: https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Inventories
- integration with Separe-World-Items: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/separe-world-items.74148/
- integration with MyWorlds: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/myworlds.39594/
